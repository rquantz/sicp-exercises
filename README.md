#SICP Exercises

This is a collection of my solutions to the exercises from [The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/) by Abelson, Sussman, and Sussman.

##The Rules
* I will only include the exercises that call for meaningful coding, not prose or the evaluation of a series of statements.
* This is an open book quiz! I will feel free to look at reference material, but will attempt to avoid reading other solutions to the exercises.
* All answers are in mit-scheme.
